How to create, add and update my project to a github repo!

cd TechEd // moves to the directory TechEd
cd week01-assignment // moves to the directory week01-assignment
git add . //takes all changes and adds them to the git folder(directory only)
git commit -m "upload basic website files" //this is creates a commit of all added files in the directory
git push // this actually pushes the commited files to github
